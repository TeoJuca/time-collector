# time-collector

This timer allows you to keep track of how long you've spent working on each project, to help more accurately estimate your time for future projects.

This timer is an ongoing open-source collaboration associated with Zero to Mastery, a coding community surrounding the Zero To Mastery: Complete Web Developer programming courses on Udemy. For information about current functionality and planned feature progress, please refer to SDD.md in the project directory.
