## Functionality details
------------------------------------------------------------

### Landing Page
**Suggestion**
The landing page is clean/minimalist, which is really nice, however there could be more information added to this page, i.e., in desktop mode there is space to the left and right for, perhaps, a vertical bar of buttons or links. For example: link to the github repository, link to the ztm course, description of the app, documentation for the app, etc... Further, keep in mind that these sidebars would need to move down and center when in mobile mode.

### Sign in options
The app currently has buttons for simple auth with email and password or option to sign in with google, facebook, github. 
These need to be made functional.

### Guest mode
Users are able to use the app without signing in, simply by clicking the button: start to collect. This mode offers full functionality, except for the ability to store seesion data to the database.

### New project
Users should be able to add details about a project and the client.

- Project number
- Project name
- Client name
- Address
- Telephone number
- Email

## Design details
------------------------------------------------------------

### Menu
There is a really nice menu in file called menu.html. This needs to be incorporated into the main document as a pop up/modal type of full page meny. Keep in mind that there are at least two states for this menu, signed in or not signed in.
**Suggestion:**
Make the width of this menu so that the log out button is the same wdith as it would be in the landing page, and then fade or dull the surrounding area to maintain a full page style.

### Logo
At current the logo is a simple fontawesome icon: fa-clock.
**Suggestion:** 
re-create the clock using either pure css or svg, which will enable us to animate the hands to let them spin slowly.

### Colors
Please feel free to update this section with a schematic of colours used so far in normal theme and dark-theme.

### Typography
Please feel free to update this section with a schematic of fonts used so far

### Design language

### Dark-Theme
The dark-theme is currently being built side-by-side to the original normal theme in its own folder. 
One drawback is that all changes should be x twice, one for each mode. 
One opportunity is that when bringing existing material over from normal theme, one can strip back and clean up all the excess files and data, since as you will notice their are many extra files and data in normal mode.

## Tech details
------------------------------------------------------------

### Description
### Frontend
### CSS
At current, the project has two seperate themes, normal and dark-theme. The diffence in themes is that each one has its own css file: 
   - normal = bootstrap.min and style.css
   - dark-theme = bootstrap cdn and darkstyle.css
Both themes still share the same resources for fonts and fontawesome icons.

### Backend
